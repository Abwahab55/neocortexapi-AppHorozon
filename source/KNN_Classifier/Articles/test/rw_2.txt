The EFL is asking the Premier League to halve the financial gap between the top flight and the Championship as part of negotiations over a new settlement for English football.

As the government revealed that the long-awaited white paper on an independent regulator is due to be put before parliament in a fortnight, the EFL and Premier League continue to wrangle over the details of a deal that would see more money move down the football pyramid.

The EFL has long called for the Premier League to share 25% of its TV revenue with its 72 clubs, but has met with strong resistance and recently wrote to clubs saying it was “not hopeful” of achieving such a goal. Although the EFL has not dropped its ambition, nor its hopes of greater funding for League One and League Two clubs to make them financially sustainable, the emphasis now appears to be on reducing the financial difference between the top tier and the Championship. Last season Norwich City earned £100m for finishing 20th in the Premier League and Fulham earned about £10m by winning the Championship.
