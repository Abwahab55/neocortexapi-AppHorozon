The German Bundesliga is one of Europe's top football leagues and has produced some of the world's best players over the years. With 18 teams competing each year, the league is known for its passionate fans, high-scoring matches, and competitive balance.

The current season has been dominated by Bayern Munich, who have been in outstanding form, winning 20 of their 22 matches so far. With a formidable squad, including star players like Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller, it's no surprise that Bayern are running away with the league title.

However, the race for second place has been a closely contested battle, with RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund, and Eintracht Frankfurt all in contention. RB Leipzig, in particular, have been a standout team this season, with their young and talented squad putting in some impressive performances.

Another team to watch out for is Borussia Monchengladbach, who have been consistently performing well and sit just a few points behind the top teams. Their manager, Marco Rose, has been instrumental in their success, and the team has a strong chance of securing a Champions League spot for next season.That was Mbappé’s first contribution in a game where he had been held quiet to that point, and he quickly gave a reminder of why he is considered the heir to Messi’s throne. Just a minute later, Coman played in Mbappé, who volleyed it into the net after it was sent back across by Marcus Thuram. Argentina were suddenly stunned and on their heels, Messi’s moment in danger of evaporating.

It was Messi, though, who delivered an extra-time goal that seemed to put the trophy back into Argentina’s hands. The ball came off Hugo Lloris, who had saved Lautaro Martínez’s initial shot, and Messi, on his right leg, whacked it just over the line for a 3-2 lead. 

Mbappé and France, though, had one gasp left. Montiel’s handball in the box gave the 23-year-old superstar another penalty kick with two minutes left in extra time. There was no question he would finish the hat trick, and in short order, he did — sealing the Golden Boot for the most goals in the tournament. France nearly won it two minutes into stoppage time, forcing Argentina keeper Emiliano Martínez into a desperation kick save on Muani, but Martínez’s foot found the ball, and sent the game into penalties. 

That was where France finally succumbed, with Martínez getting a hand to Kingsley Coman’s attempt and Aurélien Tchouaméni missing wide left. Argentina were a flawless four-for-four, and it was only right that Montiel provided the winner. 

“There are a lot of emotions, but it’s cruel in the end,” Deschamps said. “We are close to something we could have touched, but it is not the case.”
